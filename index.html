								<h2> Hello! This is Poulomi* here :) </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/poulomi.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; float: right;"/></span>
								<p>I am currently a second year PhD candidate in Astronomy at the University of Padova, Italy at the <a href= "http://www.dfa.unipd.it/en/" target="_blank">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a>. My research delves into the broad area of galaxy evolution, with a particular focus on understanding the properties of high redshift galaxies (<i>which are definitely not close to us)</i>. I am also a part of the <a href= "http://www.dfa.unipd.it/en/research/research-areas-and-groups/5-astrophysics-and-cosmology/evolution-of-galaxies-and-active-galactic-nuclei/" target= "_blank">Galaxy Evolution and AGN group</a> at Padova.</p> 
								<br><p>The goal of my PhD project is to understand the interplay between stars, dust, and the interstellar medium in normal main-sequence galaxies between redshift 4 and 6 which are a sub-sample of the <a href= "http://alpine.ipac.caltech.edu/"  target="_blank">ALPINE galaxies</a> and it is a part of the ALMA large program. To achieve this, I am using observational data by combining deep ALMA [CII] emission maps from higher-resolution ALMA data with JWST data both in spectroscopic and photometric context. I am particularly interested in the resolved studies of these galaxies and understand their formation histories.</p> I am working under the supervision of <a href= "https://www.dfa.unipd.it/live-personale/dettaglio/index.php?key=AC9FD8E5B1FE0415494A74142EDA0614" target="_blank"> Prof. Paolo Cassata</a> at University of Padova and am co-supervised by <a href= "https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~afaisst/"  target="_blank">Prof. Andreas Faisst</a> at California Institute of Technology.
								<br>
								<br>
								<p> Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed the integrated BS-MS at the <a href="http://www.iiserbpr.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhmapur</a> with major in Physics and minoring in Biology. The topic of my Master's thesis was "Star Formation Characteristics in Galaxies Hosting Active Galactic Nuclei" where I studied nearby Seyfert galaxies to understand if there is any connection between AGN and the host galaxy which might affect the star formation scenarios at different spatial scales. Moreover, I completed the thesis as a part of the Visiting Research Programme at the <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/" target="_blank"> Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore</a> under the supervision of <a href= "https://www.iiap.res.in/people/profile/academic/c-s-stalin/" target="_blank"> Prof. C. S. Stalin.</a>

								<p>As an observational astronomer, my research focuses on understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies across different epochs. Currently, as a PhD student, I am studying the higher redshift galaxies while I have also had the opportunity to work on nearby galaxies previously as an undergraduate.     </p>

								<h3>Spatially Resolved Study of ALPINE Galaxies</h3>
								<p>Galaxies between redshift 4 and 6 play a crucial role in our understanding of cosmic evolution, particularly in the context of star formation. This epoch marks a period of rapid galaxy growth, where the Star-Formation Rate Density of the Universe peaked, increasing nearly 20 times compared to earlier epochs. Studying these galaxies provides insight into the complex interplay between stars, dust, and the interstellar medium (ISM), which governs galaxy evolution.
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/project.png" alt="" style="float: down;"/></span>
								</p>In this context, the ALPINE sample which are spectroscopically confirmed main-sequence galaxies in this redshift range, are the ideal dataset for such studies. Having ALMA observations and including [CII] emission with high-resolution imaging from projects like CRISTAL, it is possible to obtain key information on the ISM properties. The recent addition of JWST NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey has, for the first time, resolved the optical rest-frame morphology of many of these galaxies. By leveraging multi-wavelength data from HST, JWST, and ALMA, I am trying to build a proper understanding of the various galaxy properties and how these evolved over the cosmic history.</p>

							    <h3>Star Formation Scenarios in Nearby AGN Host Galaxies</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/UVIT.png" alt="" style="width: 270px; height: 400px;float: right;"/></span>
								<p>The primary goal of the study was to characterize the star forming properties of the hosts of AGN by
									identifying the star-forming clumps using images from UVIT on-board AstroSat. In this project, I have
									estimated the star formation rates (SFRs), colours, ages and luminosities along with their variation from
									the center of the AGN to find any possible trend with distance in eight different sources which are mostly
									nearby galaxies having redshift less than 0.02. We found that the ratio of SFR in circum-nuclear region to the outer regions were poitively correlated with thE Eddington ratio, which is possibly due to the influence of AGNs.</p>

								<h3>Correlation Analysis between Radio and Optical Variations in OJ-287</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lightcurve.png" alt="" style="width: 280px; height: 210px;float: right;"/></span>
								<p> OJ287 is a luminous blazar and a key target for studying black holes, as it harbors a supermassive black hole binary at its core. It serves as an excellent case for exploring the connection between radio and optical emissions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Under the guidance of Prof. A. Gopakumar at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, I worked on a project analyzing the correlation between optical and radio flux variations in OJ287. Our study revealed that optical emissions preceded radio emissions, and we established a relationship linking the observed time delay of maximum correlation with the corresponding radio frequencies: 4.8, 8.0, and 14.5 GHz over a century of optical V-band data.</p>

<!-- 								<span class="image main"><img src="images/outreach.jpg" alt=""style="width: 280px; height: 210px;float: right;" /></span> -->
								<p>As a person hailing from a small town in India, I strongly feel that science communication and outreach are integral in spreading awareness about one's research and the scientific community at large. Since my undergraduate days, I have tried to engage in several outreach activities whether through public talks, writing, or interactive sessions. I truly enjoy making complex astronomical concepts accessible and engaging. This photograph is from an event organised for high school students and was probably the first time I gave a public outreach talk!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/outreach.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; float: right;"/></span>
								<br>
								<p> I believe science should be for everyone, and hence, it is important that the outreach activities should be inclusive as well. To support this, I along with my colleagues, have designed a fun activity for the <a href= "https://www.astronomiacastellaro.oapd.inaf.it/il-programma-2024/i-laboratori-2024" target="_blank">Astronomy Festival</a> (in Italian) titled "Telescopes: Messengers from Space" so that specially abled people could also participate and enjoy learning about science. A full description of the activity can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_weFHqSIu_GIS7CJ6J8IiBgaKCVAXph/view?usp=drive_link"  target="_blank">here.</a></p>

								<p>As a woman in STEM, I also like to take part in initiatives which help to close the gender gap in research. I am a member of <a href="https://carinas.co.in/" target="_blank">CARINAS</a> which is a global non-profit forum of early-career Cosmologists and Astronomers of Indian origin. Specifically, I am a member of the GalPal team which provides mentoring opportunities to masters and bachelors students and also contributing to the upcoming newsletter as a member of the editorial board.  Currently, I'm also collaborating on a series called #FirstGenStories, an initiative by Bibiana Prinoth (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/astro.bibi_/?hl=en" target="_blank">@astro.bibi_</a>) on instagram which focuses on the amazing and unique stories of first generation PhD students.</p>

							<p>Since my childhood, I have always liked to take part in cultural activities due to the rich Bengali culture I have grown up in. I am a trained Kathak dancer, which is an Indian clasical dance form and from time to time, I take part in cultural activities. For a person living 7000 kms away from home, I feel this is something which brings me close to my roots. I am also a rookie in playing the piano, a hobby which I developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>
							<br>
							<p>While moving across the world has been challenging, I have found my passion for travelling and exploring new experiences. I have always been enthusiastic about learning new languages and culture and so, whenever I get some time off, I try to visit new places. Of course, living in Europe has made it easier to learn about the diverse culture and heritage. </p>
	                        <p></p>
							<p>Exploring new places is always an adventure and I love preserving those memories through my phone camera. These are few captures of my travel diary.Click on the pins to open the images in this map below and feel free to use them if they catch your interest!</p>
